# CHANGELOG

This file is a manually maintained list of changes for each release. Feel free
to add your changes here when sending pull requests. Also send corrections if
you spot any mistakes.

## 0.5.0 (xxxx-xx-xx)

*   Feature: Added support to force extracting phar archives. This options is
    disabled by default for performance reasons, to enable use the config key
    `extra.phar.force-extract` in the `composer.json` file:

    ```json
    "extra": {
        "phar": {
            "force-extract": true
        }
    }
    ```

    Or use `--force-extract` option in the command line:

    ```bash
    $ phar-composer build --force-extract https://github.com/clue/phar-composer.git
    ```
    
    CLI option will override the value in the config key.

## 0.4.0 (2013-09-12)

*   Feature: New `install` command will now both build the given package and then
    install it into the system-wide bin directory `/usr/local/bin` (usually already
    in your `$PATH`). This works for any package name or URL just like with the
    `build` command, e.g.:

    ```bash
    $ phar-composer install phpunit/phpunit
    ```

    After some (lengthy) build output, you should now be able to run it by just issuing:

    ```bash
    $ phpunit
    ```

*   Feature: New `search` command provides an interactive command line search.
    It will ask for the package name and issue an search via packagist.org's API and
    present a list of matching packages. So if you don't know the exact package name,
    you can now use the following command:

    ```bash
    $ phar-composer search boris
    ```

*   Feature: Both `build` and `install` commands now also optionally accept an
    additional target directory to place the resulting phar into.

## 0.3.0 (2013-08-21)

*   Feature: Resulting phar files can now be executed on systems without
    ext-phar (#8). This vastly improves portability for legacy setups by including
    a small startup script which self-extracts the current archive into a temporary
    directory.

*   Feature: Resulting phar files can now be executed without the phar file name
    extension. E.g. this convenient feature now allows you to move your `~demo.phar`
    to `/usr/bin/demo` for easy system wide installations.

*   Fix: Resolving absolute paths to `vendor/autoload.php`

## 0.2.0 (2013-08-15)

*   Feature: Packages can now also be cloned from any git URLs (#9), like this:

    ```bash
    $ phar-composer build https://github.com/clue/phar-composer.git
    ```

    The above will clone the repository and check out the default branch.
    You can also specify either a tag or branch name very similar to how composer works:

    ```bash
    $ phar-composer build https://github.com/clue/phar-composer.git:dev-master
    ```

## 0.1.0 (2013-08-12)

*   Feature: Packages listed on packagist.org can now automatically be downloaded and installed
    prior to generating phar (#7), like this:

    ```bash
    $ phar-composer build clue/phar-composer
    ```

    The above will download and install the latest stable tagged release (if any).
    You can also specify a tagged version like this:

    ```bash
    $ phar-composer build clue/phar-composer:0.1.*
    ```

    Or you can specify to install the head of a given branch like this:

    ```bash
    $ phar-composer build clue/phar-composer:dev-master
    ```

## 0.0.2 (2013-05-25)

*   Feature: Bundle complete project directories

## 0.0.1 (2013-05-18)

*   First tagged release
