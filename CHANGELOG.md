# CHANGELOG

This file is a manually maintained list of changes for each release. Feel free
to add your changes here when sending pull requests. Also send corrections if
you spot any mistakes.

## 0.6.0 (2014-xx-xx)

*   Feature: Can now be installed as a `require-dev` composer dependency and
    supports running as `./vendor/bin/phar-composer`.
    ([#36](https://github.com/clue/phar-composer/pull/36), thanks @radford)
*   Feature: When composer or composer.phar is available in CLI `.json` files
    passed to `PharComposer` are validated. In case of validation errors a
    RuntimeException will be thrown.
    ([#36](https://github.com/clue/phar-composer/pull/48), thanks @staabm)

## 0.5.0 (2014-07-10)

*   Feature: The `search` command is the new default if you do not pass any command
    ([#13](https://github.com/clue/phar-composer/pull/13)).
    You can now use the following command to get started:

    ```bash
    $ phar-composer
    ```

*   Fix: Pass through STDERR output of child processes instead of aborting
    ([#33](https://github.com/clue/phar-composer/pull/33))

*   Fix: Do not timeout when child process takes longer than 60s.
    This also helps users with slower internet connections.
    ([#31](https://github.com/clue/phar-composer/pull/31))

*   Fix: Update broken dependencies
    ([#18](https://github.com/clue/phar-composer/pull/18))

*   Fix: Fixed an undocumented config key
    ([#14](https://github.com/clue/phar-composer/pull/14), thanks @mikey179)

## 0.4.0 (2013-09-12)

*   Feature: New `install` command will now both build the given package and then
    install it into the system-wide bin directory `/usr/local/bin` (usually already
    in your `$PATH`). This works for any package name or URL just like with the
    `build` command, e.g.:

    ```bash
    $ phar-composer install phpunit/phpunit
    ```

    After some (lengthy) build output, you should now be able to run it by just issuing:

    ```bash
    $ phpunit
    ```

*   Feature: New `search` command provides an interactive command line search.
    It will ask for the package name and issue an search via packagist.org's API and
    present a list of matching packages. So if you don't know the exact package name,
    you can now use the following command:

    ```bash
    $ phar-composer search boris
    ```

*   Feature: Both `build` and `install` commands now also optionally accept an
    additional target directory to place the resulting phar into.

## 0.3.0 (2013-08-21)

*   Feature: Resulting phar files can now be executed on systems without
    ext-phar (#8). This vastly improves portability for legacy setups by including
    a small startup script which self-extracts the current archive into a temporary
    directory.

*   Feature: Resulting phar files can now be executed without the phar file name
    extension. E.g. this convenient feature now allows you to move your `~demo.phar`
    to `/usr/bin/demo` for easy system wide installations.

*   Fix: Resolving absolute paths to `vendor/autoload.php`

## 0.2.0 (2013-08-15)

*   Feature: Packages can now also be cloned from any git URLs (#9), like this:

    ```bash
    $ phar-composer build https://github.com/clue/phar-composer.git
    ```

    The above will clone the repository and check out the default branch.
    You can also specify either a tag or branch name very similar to how composer works:

    ```bash
    $ phar-composer build https://github.com/clue/phar-composer.git:dev-master
    ```

## 0.1.0 (2013-08-12)

*   Feature: Packages listed on packagist.org can now automatically be downloaded and installed
    prior to generating phar (#7), like this:

    ```bash
    $ phar-composer build clue/phar-composer
    ```

    The above will download and install the latest stable tagged release (if any).
    You can also specify a tagged version like this:

    ```bash
    $ phar-composer build clue/phar-composer:0.1.*
    ```

    Or you can specify to install the head of a given branch like this:

    ```bash
    $ phar-composer build clue/phar-composer:dev-master
    ```

## 0.0.2 (2013-05-25)

*   Feature: Bundle complete project directories

## 0.0.1 (2013-05-18)

*   First tagged release
